## What is Unify?
Unify is a cultural diversity-based web application that serves as a trading platform for individuals to showcase and exchange traditional products from their respective cultures.

Users can upload their unique traditional items, browse others' collections, and express interest in trading.
The platform's matching feature automatically matches users who are interested in each other's items.
This provides an opportunity for individuals to connect with others and gain a deeper understanding of different cultures.
Unify promotes cultural diversity and aims to bridge cultural gaps by providing a space for individuals to share their traditions and customs.

## ü§ñOur Tech Stack
To begin with, first, we did User Research. Next, we created the user flow and functionality. This led us to high-fidelity design and implementation. Here is our tech stack.

- We chose Next.js as the primary technology for the front-end development of the web application.
- We used Supabase as the backend platform to store and manage the application data in real-time, leveraging its real-time database capabilities to enable the matching feature.
- For the UI design and prototyping of the application, we used Figma, a collaborative design tool that allowed us to create and share design assets and collaborate seamlessly with the team.
- To style the application, we used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that enabled us to create custom styles easily and quickly.
- The application was built using TypeScript, which allowed us to catch errors during development and improve the overall maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
- We implemented the real-time database feature using Supabase's real-time subscription API, which allowed us to push data updates to clients in real time, creating a seamless user experience.
